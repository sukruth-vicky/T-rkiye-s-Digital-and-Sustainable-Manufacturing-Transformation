Türkiye is strengthening its position as a global manufacturing hub by advancing digital capabilities and building sustainable industrial practices. 
The transformation is led by MESS and supported by its innovation center, MEXT, in collaboration with McKinsey and Company. 
Türkiye aims to reinvent how industries operate by bringing technology, sustainability, and workforce capability together.

Manufacturing contributes significantly to Türkiye’s economy, but companies face increasing pressure from global competition, rising environmental expectations, and a fast-evolving technological landscape. 
To remain competitive, industries must adopt digital tools, redesign workflows, embrace automation, and build new skills within the workforce.

MEXT was created as a large-scale transformation center where companies can learn, test, and deploy new technologies. 
The approach includes real factory simulations, digital twin experiences, capability-building programs, and hands-on implementation support. 
McKinsey helps companies assess their current maturity and design transformation roadmaps using structured frameworks.

Türkiye’s journey focuses on adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, scaling digital use cases, and developing sustainable operations. 
The center works with thousands of professionals across different sectors, helping businesses identify gaps, evaluate technology readiness, and accelerate deployment. 
Sustainability is a core part of the approach, integrating energy efficiency, circularity, and responsible production models.

Early results show clear progress. Companies improved productivity, strengthened operational reliability, reduced waste, and upskilled employees through targeted capability-building. 
The transformation demonstrates how a nation can amplify its industrial strength by aligning digital innovation with sustainability goals.

Türkiye’s strategy shows that transformation succeeds when ecosystems collaborate. 
With industry associations, technology partners, academia, and McKinsey working together, companies gain the knowledge, tools, and support needed to modernize at scale.
